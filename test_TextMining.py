It appears as though the consumer was upset with Machelle Parker, as she was unable to clearly communicate to the consumer the reason for the requirement. Leadership has confirmed that coaching has been provided to Machelle.  The consumer is transferred to the Team Captain, Brittney Vaughn who provides the same information; still frustrated Andrew requests that the Team leader contact him. Brittney reaches out to Team Leader, Chris Layton via phone advising him of the issue and requests that he e-mail the consumer.
